# 2021 Advent of Code
December coding challenge that I'm doing with friends
- Run file - ```node day_1.js```
- Run tests - ```npx jest```

## Notes
#### JavaScript
- Remember that fill uses object references, when you fill with an object and it's updated, all the values get changed
- Always remember to change STRING inputs into numbers with parseInt
- npmlog sucks with Jest unit tests - all the log prefixes get messed with
